    "1. For each demand of plasma conduit from each colony, we create a vertex. That is, 20 vertices for Triacus, 30 for NewBerlin, 30 for strnad and 45 for Vega. We denote these vertices as $v_{d_{i}}, 1 \\leq i \\leq 125$\n",

    "3. From each demand vertex, we draw an edge to all supply vertices, that is $125 * 125$ edges.The weight $\\omega_{e}$ of these edges are assigned according to the shipping price from the startbases to the colonies they connect. For example, the fist 20 demand vertices $v_{d_{i}}, 1 \\leq i \\leq 20$ represent the demand of Triacus, each of these vertices has an edge with weight 6 to the first 35 supply vertices $v_{s_{j}}, 1 \\leq j \\leq 35$ which represent the supply from starbase Farpoint.\n",
    "4. We denote all the vertices and edges described above as graph $G = (V, E)$ and we introduct variables $x_{e}$ for each edge $e \\in E$, that can attain values $0$ or $1$, with value $0$ means the edge is not included in the final result, $1$ the opposite.Then the weighted bipartite matching problem can be formulated as\n",

The equivalence between the original transportation problem and the LP relaxation form of problem in step 5 is then proved.\n",

Then by **Lemma 3** and **Themrem 2** we mentioned above, the problem in step 5 has integral optimal solution, which means that the transportation problem in assignment 1 has optimal integral solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "**4.c** The result of this rounding rule is a vertex cover because every edge is examined and guaranteed to be covered by at least one edge. Let $x_{u}$ be a variable corresponding to vertex $u$ which we meet in the procudure of applying our rounding rule. If $x_{u} \\ge 0.5$, we round it to $1$ and add this $u$ to the result set. Now consider all the edges that are incidental to $u$, denote them as set $S_{u}$. For any edge $e \\in S_{u}$, by the rule of our new rounding method, if $e$ is already covered by some vertex, then we add nothing to our current result set. Otherwise, we choose the vertex with the greater value, which must be $u$ because we can't have both vertices of this edge having value larger or equal than 0.5. Once $u$ is added to the result set, other edges from $S_{u}$ will be ignored. If $x_{u} \\lt 0.5$, both the rounding rule and the new rounding method won't add it to the result. By reasoning like this, we are sure that the method in this part has cost no more than that corresponding to the rounding rule in part (b). Again, the value is still quite far from the optimal value, but as just mentioned, still better than the rounding method from the previous question."
